# NzpTest

  React Native + Dijkstra + Redux

  It is needed to improve:

  input control (at this point it is requested to enter only expected nodes: from A to J),

  draw dijkstra's graph,

  show information title after click on go button,

  or rote to other scene

  add a space between nodes in the path item

  Integrate with bitrise (https://www.bitrise.io)

  It is assumed if start node and end node are the same, shortest path is the same node
